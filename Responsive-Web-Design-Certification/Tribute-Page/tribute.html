            <h2>About Jane Austen</h2>
            <p>Jane Austen (1775-1817) was an English novelist known primarily for her six major novels, which include Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, and Emma. Her novels often critiqued the manners and customs of the British landed gentry of the end of the 18th century. Austen's plots also explore the dependence of women on marriage in the pursuit of economic security. Her stories portray headstrong women who manage to find a marriage partner they love and who does not risk their financial security. Her use of biting irony, along with her realism and social commentary, have earned her acclaim among critics and scholars.</p>
